title: Markdown Syntax Template
summary: "This is your base markdown template and the file you should make edits to. When you make edits and commit the changes to the <code>main</code> branch the changes will show up here. Use the sidebar to navigate to the tutorial pages I've included. Some of them are pretty advanced and may not apply to you unless you are working in the CLI. However, there is some good information on markdown formatting and advanced markdown tools I've included with this build."
